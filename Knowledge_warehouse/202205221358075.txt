2,in my opinion Compared with men, women tend to think more emotionally and think more delicately.  Men, on the other hand, tend to be more rational and are more likely to do things thoughtfully.  
Women are very aware of what they're thinking and feeling, so they react quickly and are more likely to spot problems.  Men, on the other hand, need time to think and analyze before making a decision. They may not be as quick to react as women, but they can see things clearly.
